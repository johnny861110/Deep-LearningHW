# Deep-LearningHW

## use learning algorithm to raise model performance 

### first week is two layer NN plus keras tuner 
use hyperopt select hyperparameter setting

### second week will be weight tuning algorithm
use epoch bound、learning goal、conditonal learning rate adjustment ...etc, raise model performance
